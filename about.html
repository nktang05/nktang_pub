        <p>
          The World War II Camp Wall Memorial is a project to install a national monument at Columbia Park in Torrance, CA,
          which will memorialize the names of over 120,000 Americans who were unjustly incarcerated in War Relocation
          Authority camps during World War II.

          this project, and now collaborate with the City of Torrance.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Summer of 2023, I was one of four data interns in the cohort, where we were tasked to provide a proof of
          concept for the wall by capturing the names in a database and creating visualizations for the wall showing variants
          of how the names could be displayed, and additional educational information.
