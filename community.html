      <h3>Camp Kesem at USC</h3>
      <p id="carousel-text">
        I have been involved with USC’s Camp Kesem chapter since my freshman year. I have served as a counselor, unit leader, and am now starting my third year as an executive board member. As a counselor and unit leader, I developed friendships with kids whose lives are impacted by a parent's cancer through the week-long summer camp. As a board member, my responsibilities have included outreach, networking, fundraising, counselor training, meeting planning, and community engagement. Through my Kesem experience and my own journey dealing with my parents’ cancer, I have learned about the importance of resilience, empathy, positivity, and inclusion — making everyone feel that despite their challenges, they are not alone.

      <h3>Japanese American Advocacy</h3>
      <p>
        As a fifth-generation Japanese American, my family’s history is deeply shaped by the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II. My grandparents’ families were imprisoned at the Jerome and Rohwer camps, and my grandfather, Kanji Sahara, dedicated much of his life to ensuring these injustices were never forgotten, serving as a docent at the Japanese American National Museum and leading educational projects. Growing up, I attended many of his events, which instilled in me a strong sense of cultural identity, community responsibility, and the importance of historical remembrance. I later continued his legacy by interning with the World War II Camp Wall project, organizing records of over 240,000 incarcerated individuals to preserve their stories through data. These experiences have deeply connected me to my heritage and inspire my ongoing commitment to education, remembrance, and advocacy.

      <h3>Cancer & Stem Cell Registry Advocacy</h3>
      <p>
        I have previously been involved with Asians for Miracle Marrow Matches, A3M, where I educated people in my community on the importance of joining the Bone Marrow Registry and being willing to donate bone marrow. I made video interviews with stem cell transplant recipients and patients to use as an education tool, as well as gave in person presentations at several events. As ethnicity plays a major role in matching a patient to a donor, I placed emphasis on diversity as minorities are underrepresented within the registry. Working with (A3M) taught me how ethnicity plays a huge role in receiving healthcare as well as how culture can influence an individual’s decision to join the registry so it is always important to approach health topics while being educationally and culturally sensitive.

      <h3>Nature & the Outdoors</h3>
      <p>
        I love being outside whether it’s hiking, camping, snowboarding, or exploring somewhere new. Nature is where I feel the most relaxed and happy. Climbing Mt. Whitney was one of the hardest things I’ve done but it was so worth it and made me want to take on more big adventures. I’m always down for a good trail or a chill camping trip with friends. Backpacking to Machu Picchu is definitely on my bucket list because it seems like such an epic trip.
